# Describe relative order for patches which need to be applied in a specific
# order.
#
# Groups are separated by at least one empty line. Every patch within a group
# must be applied in that order relative to the other patches within the same
# group.
#
# The same patch can be part of multiple groups, but no patch must occur more
# than once in the same group.
#
# Comments like this line will be ignored.
#
# The lines within a group consist of the patch file name optionally being
# followed by a patch ID.
#
# Patch IDs are arbitrary strings which should to be unique in space and time
# not containing any whitespace characters, and identify the contents of a
# patch rather than its name.
#
# Where a patch ID is present, the patch name serves only as a comment, will
# be completely ignored, and only the patch ID will be used to locate the
# actual name of the patch file.
#
# There are two types of patch IDs: Autogenerated and manually assigned.
#
# Manually assigned IDs are taken from the patch header where a line
#
# Unique Patch ID: foo
#
# needs to present, defining "foo" as the patch ID in this example.
#
# Autogenerated IDs are constructed from the contents of all patch files
# not defining their own IDs was follows:
#
# * The patch is stripped of all lines up to (and including) the first line
#   starting with "+++ ".
#
# * All whitespace, control characters and backslash-characters of the
#   remaining lines are removed, including newlines.
#
# * All ASCII characters a-z are converted into uppercase.
#
# * The binary mode MD5 checksum of the resulting output is calculated.
#
# * The checksum is converted from its hexadecimal representation into
#   16 binary bytes (in the same order).
#
# * The bytes are base-E91-encoded into a string of 20 characters.
#
# * This string represents the autogenerated patch ID.
