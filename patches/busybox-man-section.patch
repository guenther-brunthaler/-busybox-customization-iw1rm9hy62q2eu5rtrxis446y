This patch fixes BusyBox' handling of man-sections which start with a
digit, but have letters appended.

For instance, using non-busybox "man", the following will be found:

$ man -w OpenSSL_add_all_ciphers
/usr/share/man/man3/OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms.3ssl.gz

But Busybox won't, because it would try

/usr/share/man/man3ssl/OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms.3ssl.gz

and

/usr/share/man/man3/OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms.3.gz

but not the correct path shown above.

This patch eliminates this problem by trying the subdirectory name with
and without the non-numeric suffix.
