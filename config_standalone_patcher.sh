#! /bin/sh
# Filter for modifying a normalized configuration as created by
# ./config_normalizer, enabling options to build a statically-linked
# "stand-alone" version of Busybox, which allows all applets to be used in the
# built-in shell without actually installing them anywhere in the real file
# system. This is very convenient when used for emergency recovery, but has
# the severy disadvantage that PATH is mostly ignored and the only way to
# override the built-in applets is manually specifying the full path to a
# replacement utility.
